The RunManager is the only mandatory manager object that the user must create. The EventManager, SteppingManagerâ€¦ are created and deleted manually by this main one. This manager controls the flow of a run including the set up of the simulation environment. When running [[Multithreading]] mode, the class should be substituted by G4MTRunManager

The Geant4RunManager has a few requirements:
- [[G4VUserDetectorConstruction]] (defines the geometry of the problem).
- [[Physics Lists]] derived from the class [[G4VUserPhysicsList]] (defines the particles and physics interactions). 
- An Action, derived from [[G4VUserActionInitialization]] containing **at least** a Primary generator derived from [[G4VUserPrimaryGeneratorAction]].
