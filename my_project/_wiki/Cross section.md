The interaction cross section of a process ($\sigma$) can be understood as the effective area that a particle presents to another one for a particular interaction to happen. It is a measure of the probability of interaction which stems from looking at interactions from a stochastic perspective. It has units of area and is commonly given in barns ($10^{-18}$ m$^2$).
